Hello,

We used XAMPP Control panel for this class, which can be downloaded from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

We also used MySQL Workbench for the IDE, which can be downloaded from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

Run XAMPP, hit start for MySQL, run MySQL Workbench, use the local instance connection (root & localhost), open the scripts that contain the databases (just open the file), and then run the script (lightning bolt).

Most of the homework assignments use my_guitar_shop as the database. Needed databases are in the database folder.
